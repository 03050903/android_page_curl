Intro
=====
Project for trying to implement 'page curl' effect on Android + OpenGL ES 1.0 (possibly 1.1/2.0 too).

TODO
====
* Make something useful with current implementation - e.g a photo book from images found on the device.
* Find a way to calculate fake soft shadows (somewhat done - even though it doesn't work 100% yet).
* Rendering is helplessly slow. Check if GL11/GL20 provides room for speed improvement.
* Animation to continue from where user stopped dragging.
